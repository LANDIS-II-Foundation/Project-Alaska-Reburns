This is a repository for the DAMM-MCNiP model of soil decomposition, combined from the DAMM (Davidson et al. 2012 Global Change Biology) and MCNiP (Finzi et al. 2015 Global Change Biology) decomposition models. Model testing is described in the manuscript Abramoff et al. 2017 JGR: Biogeosciences, DOI: 10.1002/2017JG003796.

This model was concieved by Adrien Finzi, Eric Davidson, and Rose Abramoff, and the code was written by Rose Abramoff. The authors acknowledge prior work on MCNiP development by John Drake, Edward Brzostek, and Bridget Darby.

Please contact Rose Abramoff (rzabramoff@lbl.gov) with any questions or comments.
